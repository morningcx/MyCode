class Solution {
    public boolean increasingTriplet(int[] nums) {
        int small = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int big = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num <= small) {
                small = num;
            } else if (num <= big) {
                big = num;
            } else {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}

This is the very case that confused me when I first read OPs solution. The logic is rather terse but works for such inputs. In case anyone else is reading and would like a further elaboration:

initial : [1, 2, 0, 3], small = MAX, big = MAX
loop1 : [1, 2, 0, 3], small = 1, big = MAX
loop2 : [1, 2, 0, 3], small = 1, big = 2
loop3 : [1, 2, 0, 3], small = 0, big = 2 // <- Uh oh, 0 technically appeared after 2
loop4 : return true since 3 > small && 3 > big // Isn't this a violation??

If you observe carefully, the moment we updated big from MAX to some other value, that means that there clearly was a value less than it (which would have been assigned to small in the past). What this means is that once you find a value bigger than big, you've implicitly found an increasing triplet.
